## Welcome to my R Portfolio!

### Hi, I'm Mollie.

I’m a born and raised New Orleanian currently displaced in Washington, D.C. I love telling stories, enjoying good food, the font Monserrat, and discovering upcoming artists on Spotify. I currently work as a Project Manager and Marketing/Outreach Specialist for an upcoming software company called Uncommon Good. I recently graduated Cum Laude from The George Washington University in 2020 with a BA in Communication and a minor in Journalism and Mass Communication.
